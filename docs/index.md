# CORDH Data Harmonisation Group  


The site outlines modelling choices in relation to diverse entities described in the Consortium's data. The modelling is provided, whenever possible, using CIDOC-CRM. However, in certain cases, other ontologies are used. 
For each of the described entities, diverse encoding choices were outlined, and a decision about each of them was made. The scope of this document is not to provide a track of this process, but just to present its results. The documentation of the possible modelling and encoding of an entity in RDF can be found in the [Annex A](#).

For each entity, as an example of its use, an RDF encoding of a real-world statement is provided. The syntax of the encoding is Turtle, and all the prefix used can be found on [http://prefix.cc/](http://prefix.cc/).

On the left of the screen, the reader can see the sections of the website. The entry [Entities](modelling/) outline the main basic modelling choices with explanations and examples. While the majority of the modelling examples are in the [Entities](modelling/) section, for some specific subject, where we deemed that more explanation would be needed, we decided to have some special sections. It is the case of [Time](Time/), [Bibliographic Data](bibliographic_data/) and [Images](Images/). 

Comments and further explanations can be opened as issues in [Github](https://github.com/ncarboni/arthistorydata/).
